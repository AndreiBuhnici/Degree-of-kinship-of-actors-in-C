# Degree-of-kinship-of-actors-in-C
- Given a list of movies with the actors from the movie, the program builds a graph for the degree of kinship,
based on actors that starred in the same movies;
- Uses a BST in order to efficiently add the actors just once in the graph;
- The nodes in the graph are the actors and the edges connects them if they appeared in the same movie;
- Determines the maximum production (the biggest convex subgraph);
- It also calculates a distance vector between 2 actors (degree of kinship);
- It determines the number of bridges in a convex and writes the contents of the BST in lexicographic order;
- 2 extra files with implementations for BST and queue;
